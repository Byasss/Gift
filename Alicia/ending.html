   <div class="text2">  <b>Lemthra</b> : Hey, happy birthday! Just wanted to say thank you for being by my side ever since we became classmates. You've always been there in your own quiet, steady way, and it means a lot more than I say out loud. I really hope we stay close even as we grow up and take on life. Even though we didn’t grow up together, you feel like one of those childhood friends who just gets me—someone I can truly count on. You’ve got a special place in my heart, and I hope we make more memories, share more laughs, and always find our way back to each other no matter where life takes us.

   <div class="text3">  <b>Byash</b> :Happy birthday, my dear twin! I hope you are doing well there. I wish you could have stayed longer. Though we became good friends online, we got very few chances to talk in real life. I just wanted you to know how special you are in our lives, you illuminate the lives of those who are close to you. Having a friend like you is a blessing. I trust that distance won’t weaken the bond of our friendship. I hope thing go well for you in future and if you need any support we are ways by your side I anticipate we will forge unforgettable moments subsequently.

   <div class="text4">  <b>Laisemba</b> Happy 16th birthday, Alicia! Is everything going well there? I hope it is well. It's been months since I last saw you. I wasn't able to give u a proper farewell, I am sorry about that. I still remember us texting late at night and me trying not to sleep just to keep talking to you. I enjoyed every moment we had together in this school, and I hope everything goes well there too. There will be some struggles, but I believe you can do it; you are stronger than you think. It's still what hurts the most that I didn't get the moment to say goodbye; that day still keeps eating me from the inside, thinking I should have made the first move. I believe we will meet again in the future. Good luck with your new journey.
